## Unreleased

## v0.7.3 (2025-06-23)

### üîß Bug Fixes
- **BREAKING**: Fixed timestamp queries to use `creation_timestamp` instead of `created_at`
  - All time-based analysis now uses actual Kubernetes resource creation time
  - Affects namespace components, storage analysis, temporal analysis, and resource efficiency
  - Provides accurate age calculations and timeline reporting
- Added missing `datetime` import to views.py
  - Fixes NameError in resource efficiency export functionality
- Fixed timezone mismatch in temporal analysis
  - Made `datetime.now()` timezone-aware using `timezone.utc`
  - Consistent handling for both timezone-aware and naive timestamps
  - Prevents TypeError when comparing different timezone formats

### üìä Improvements
- Enhanced accuracy of all time-based metrics and reporting
- Improved export functionality reliability
