# Security Analysis

The Security Analysis view provides comprehensive security assessment of your Kubernetes cluster, identifying potential vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

## Overview

This analysis focuses on:

- **RBAC Analysis**: Role-based access control configuration
- **Pod Security**: Security contexts and policies
- **Network Security**: Network policies and ingress/egress rules
- **Secrets Management**: Secret usage and security
- **Image Security**: Container image vulnerabilities
- **Compliance**: Adherence to security best practices

## Security Checks

### RBAC Assessment
- Service account permissions
- ClusterRole and Role bindings
- Excessive privileges identification
- Service account token usage

### Pod Security Standards
- Security contexts validation
- Privileged containers detection
- Root user execution
- Capability assignments
- Volume mount security

### Network Security
- Network policy coverage
- Ingress/egress rules analysis
- Service exposure assessment
- Pod-to-pod communication security

### Secrets and ConfigMaps
- Secret exposure risks
- ConfigMap security
- Environment variable injection
- Volume mount security

## Security Scoring

The security analysis provides:

- **Overall Security Score**: Aggregate security rating
- **Category Scores**: Detailed scoring per security domain
- **Risk Assessment**: High, medium, and low-risk findings
- **Compliance Status**: Standards adherence (CIS, NSA/CISA, etc.)

## Usage

```bash
# Full security analysis
k8s-analyzer analyze --view security-analysis

# Focus on specific security domain
k8s-analyzer analyze --view security-analysis --filter rbac

# Generate security report
k8s-analyzer report --template security-summary
```

## Remediation Guidance

Each security finding includes:

- **Description**: What the issue is
- **Impact**: Potential security implications
- **Remediation**: Step-by-step fix instructions
- **References**: Links to security best practices

## Integration with Security Tools

The security analysis can integrate with:

- Falco for runtime security
- OPA Gatekeeper for policy enforcement
- Twistlock/Prisma for image scanning
- Aqua Security for comprehensive protection
