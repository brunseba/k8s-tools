# Temporal Analysis

The Temporal Analysis view provides insights into time-based trends and behaviors in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Overview

This analysis focuses on:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Metrics collected over time
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Weekly/daily patterns in cluster usage
- **Temporal Anomalies**: Short-term abnormal behaviors
- **Trend Forecasting**: Long-term trends prediction

## Key Components

### Time Series Metrics
- CPU and memory usage over time
- Network traffic patterns
- Persistent storage usage
- Pod creation and deletion rates

### Patterns and Trends
- **Daily Patterns**: Usage starts, peaks, and ends
  - Example: Increased usage during work hours
- **Weekly Trends**: Weekly recurring patterns
  - Example: Increased weekend batch processing

### Anomaly Detection
- Sudden spikes in usage
- Unexpected drops in resource consumption
- Anomalies in pod lifecycle events

### Forecasting and Predictions
- CPU and memory usage forecasting
- Storage needs prediction
- Network demand forecasts

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Perform temporal analysis
k8s-analyzer analyze --view temporal-analysis

# Focus on specific metrics
k8s-analyzer analyze --view temporal-analysis --metrics cpu,network

# Create trend forecast reports
k8s-analyzer forecast --output report.csv
```

## Integration

### Monitoring Tools
- Prometheus for long-term metrics storage
- Grafana for time series visualization
- ML algorithms for anomaly detection and prediction

### Automating Forecasts
- CI/CD pipeline integration for scheduled forecasts
- Integration with resource management for proactive scaling
- Alerts based on trend deviations and anomalies

## Best Practices

### Metrics Collection
1. **Granular Data**: Collect detailed metrics for accuracy
2. **Diverse Metrics**: Cover CPU, memory, network, and storage
3. **Long-Term Retention**: Store historical data for trend identification

### Data Usage
1. **Visualize**: Use dashboards for real-time insights
2. **Automate**: Utilize CI/CD for trend-based decisions
3. **Analyze**: Regularly review and adapt resource allocations
