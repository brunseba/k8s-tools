   ```
3. **Create a feature branch**:

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Development Process

#### Setting up Development Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync --dev

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

#### Code Standards

- **Python Version**: >= 3.10 (as per project rules)
- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8, enforced by pre-commit hooks
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all functions and methods
- **Documentation**: Document all public APIs and functions

#### Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits for consistent commit messages:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
feat(analyzer): add new cluster analysis view
fix(reporter): resolve dashboard rendering issue
docs(api): update CLI reference documentation

```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation updates
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `style`: Code style changes
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

### Testing

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_analyzer.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

#### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Follow the naming convention: `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test names

```python
def test_cluster_analysis_returns_valid_data():
    """Test that cluster analysis returns properly formatted data."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

### Documentation

mkdocs build
```

#### Documentation Guidelines
